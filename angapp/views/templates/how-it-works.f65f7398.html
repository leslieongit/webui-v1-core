The financiers get exposed to a wider pool of investment opportunities that are vetted and ranked, and the financiers are appropriately rewarded for their investment. The owners of businesses have access to capital and technical skills and markets and have a chance to grow their businesses at a reasonable interest rate.</span></p></div></div></div><div style="padding-top: 100px; padding-bottom: 100px; background-color: #6c757d"><div class="ui two column stackable page grid center aligned"><div class="column col-pad"><img class="rounded" src="/images/financiers-600-600.jpg" alt="" style="margin: 0 auto"></div><div class="column col-pad" id="financiers"><div class="large-text"><h2 class="ui header text-left"><span style="color: #fff">FINANCIERS</span></h2><ul class="text-left" style="color: white"><li><p>They can be individuals or corporates or pension funds, or syndicates, or consortiums, any unit recognisable at law</p></li><li><p>After registration, they will be availed all the projects available for funding</p></li><li><p>They can invest in more than one project at a time</p></li><li><p>The minimum investment amount is USD 1000 (equivalent), and there is no maximum amount per project</p></li><li><p>There is no maximum amount per financier over the unrestricted number of projects</p></li><li><p>If the project does not raise the minimum amount requested, the funds are returned to the financier(s)</p></li><li><p>All payments are made to and from the Custodian</p></li><li><p>The minimum loan or investment period is 6 months</p></li><li><p>Other investment terms and conditions will vary depending on each project</p></li><li><p>The funding process will be open to the public for 21 days, but may be extended at the discretion of LCC</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="column col-pad"><img class="rounded" src="/images/promo-600-600.jpg" alt="" style="margin: 0 auto"></div><div class="column col-pad" id="promoters"><div class="large-text"><h2 class="ui header text-left"><span style="color: #fff">PROMOTERS</span></h2><ul class="text-left" style="color: white"><li><p>The project must have been in operation for at least 2 years before application for funding</p></li><li><p>The board and management must have no previous criminal or civil record</p></li><li><p>The project will be assessed and ranked by LCC before external parties are brought on board</p></li><li><p>The owners/directors will sign unlimited personal guarantees where a loan is being sought</p></li><li><p>Three levels of success will be set – a MINIMUM (the least amount of money to be raised), IDEAL (what the project needs), MAXIMUM (the highest amount the project will accept)</p></li><li><p>If the MINIMUM amount has not been raised at the time of closing the invitation, the money raised thus far, will be returned to the potential investors</p></li><li><p>If the IDEAL amount is reached before the closing date, the offer may be closed, subject to a 24-hour notice on the website</p></li><li><p>All payments will be from the Custodian, and loan repayments will be to the Custodian as per the terms and conditions of the loan</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="column col-pad"><img class="rounded" src="/images/advantage-600-600.jpg" alt="" style="margin: 0 auto"></div><div class="column col-pad" id="advantage"><div class="large-text"><h2 class="ui header text-left"><span style="color: #fff">WHY US</span></h2><ul class="text-left" style="color: white"><li><p>Post capital raise, the borrower will be enlisted on a consultancy program designed to monitor and grow their business over a minimum period of 12 months</p></li><li><p>LCC will issue a quarterly report to the financiers on the performance of the business</p></li><li><p>All businesses to be advanced capital will be vetted and ranked for credit and performance purposes in advance</p></li><li><p>Each borrower will be made to pay a refundable deposit of approximately 2% of the loan amount to the Custodian to cover initial recovery costs in the case of a default.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><div style="padding-top: 100px; padding-bottom: 100px; background-color: #fff"><div class="ui page grid"><div class="column text-center"><h3 class="ui header"><span style="color: #000">Now that we have read enough, why dont we go ahead to the next level</span></h3><a href="/login" class="btn btn-danger btn-lg batani">Get Started <i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div>
